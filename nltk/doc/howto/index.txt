NLTK Guides: Demonstration Code and Regression Tests
====================================================

These files serve two purposes.  First, they demonstrate
to use NLTK to perform a variety of tasks.  And second, they act as a
regression test suite, to ensure that new bugs are not accidentally
introduced into NLTK.  

Each file typically begins with a description of the topic(s) covered
by that file, followed by several sections containing explanatory
examples.  These examples should be helpful to anyone who wants to
learn more about specific pieces of NLTK.

These explanatory sections are followed by "regression test" sections,
which are meant to verify that NLTK's implementation is functioning
properly.  These sections tend to explore NLTK's behavior in a variety
of exceptional cases.  The "regression test" sections may be useful to
NLTK users, but are mainly intended for testing purposes.  In order to
help develop complete test sets, we automatically determine `which
parts of NLTK's source code are covered by tests <coverage/>`__.  Our
goal is to have 100% coverage for all modules.
